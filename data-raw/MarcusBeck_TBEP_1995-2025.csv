5216,,2003-04-07,2003-04-07,"To whom it may concern, I recently came upon something strange in my neighborhood and am wondering if you could offer some insight as to what may have happened. There is a small pond as you enter the main road into my subdivision, it is about 30 feet across at it's widest point and 125 feet long. There are 4 large carp, small bass and plenty of ducks that inhabit the pond. There is a fountain in the center and is pressumably maintained by the home owners association. Last week they have done what can only be described as ""dyed"" the water blue. I'm guessing this is done to make the water look more ""pretty"". However with in the last couple days the four large carp have died. The fourth one surfaced today and all are bloated and floating aimlessly on top of the pond (as in no one has removed them). Could this have any connection with the dyed water? None of the bass nor any other creatures have died and I have been told that it is possible the carp were poisoned on purpose since they are ""garbage"" fish, mulitply rapidly and stir dirt up causing muddy water. I would appreciate any information you could pass on to me as to what may have happened and especially if anything illegal (though that sounds like an overreaction) has occured.

While walking down by the sea wall, which has had enough sand build up that there is a small sand bar, I noticed all the dead and/or dying fish.  It appeared stingrays outnumbered everything significantly, with every size of the species there.  Also present were a few other ray species.  IN addition, there were about 60 live and dead blue crabs, dead or dying eels, 60-70 or more dead baitfish, and a few larger fish- small sheepshead and flounder.  All in all, I would estimate that there were approximately 500 dead species of fish or shellfish.

We saw many key West Grunts, Red and Gag grouper and many Puffer fish.  When we arrived at the fishing site we couldn't get a single bite.  The fish finder was showing lots of fish and so I dove down to see what was going on.  The water was 80 feet deep.  The first 20 feet the vis was 30 feet and then the next 20 feet the vis dropped to 3 feet in the bloom.  At 40 feet the bloom cleared at the thermocline and the vis returned to about 15 feet.  At  the thermocline I encountered massive schools of mangrove snapper mixed with all sizes of gag grouper and angel fish.  The fish behaved oddly.  They constantly swam up and down through the water column beneath the thermocline.  They made no attempt to evade me.  Closer to the bottom I found schools of large key west grunts swimming in the same erratic up and down pattern through the lower water column..  The odd thing about them was that all the large ones had their mouths open wide and didn't seem to have the ability to close them, even after I lightly brushed them with my hand or my spear tip.  On the bottom I saw a couple of dead hog fish and absolutely no small bait fish.  There were a couple of red grouper that didn't behave like the gags at all. They just meandered about right on the ledge and also made no attempt to evade me. This was all very disturbing.  The next dive site I went to was 75 feet deep and the same fish behavior was observed.  There were several fresh killed French grunts and tropical fish dead on the bottom and at least a hundred grouper and a thousand snapper swimming well off the bottom in tight schools. What's going on with these fish?

We didn't get too close to it, but I did notice the fish still had eyes and lips (not sure how their lips normally look - they seemed so obvious/puffy).  The fish was upright on the sand, at the water's edge, and had flies all over it.  The water had a 'garbage smell' to it, and some foam washed up on the shoreline.  This was approx. 8pm tonight, Thurs., 8/11. This red tide seems so bad this year, and so sad about the latest victims reported on the local news, the sea turtles!

Why would there be only redfish dead there? I hope we didn't lose a whole generation of breeders. UPDATE: Howie, Thanks for your reply to my fish kill report. Today there were a few more three foot long redfish dead in the Southwest Passage. This time they appeared to have just died and again there were no other kinds of fish dead on the surface. The good news is that the water is clean and top water species seem to be thriving.  There is bait everywhere, ladyfish are plentiful and for the first time this summer, I found small schools of spanish mackerel feeding in the smaller bait. ( I caught four of the mackerel and they made an excellent bowel of  ceviche). Could it be that the redfish died from eating something that had accumulated the red tide toxin in their bodies, but which were not themselves affected, like maybe crabs?

Michelle, 
        Really bad planktonic algae and an oil slick on pond #5. I swear this account is cursed! Treated planktonic. Clean-Up all the fish (missed a few that were under overhanging pepper tree, but nothing I could do to reach them...should decompose within a few days as they are moosh now). Approx. 150# of fish. All from oxygen depletion due to oil. I was able to use my boat & prop wash and push most of it toward the shallow inflow end of pond and syphoned out with my boat pump. Should look fine in 2-3 days at most. All the other ponds are looking much improved and I will boat them for underwater weeds and algae 1 more time before the end of the month and I think we will finally be back to normal. I think florida is going to be in real trouble when that gulf oil spill starts causing planktonic algae (ie. red tide) and fish start dying off.

Caller is a commercial fisherman and has been noticing an increased number of dead crabs, as well as fewer crabs than normal in his traps. Caller states there is a phosphate mine up the Alafia river but is unsure if that is the cause of the crab death. Callback from DEP requested. I spoke to one of the callers, John Vogel.  He noticed the milky water on Monday 9/19, in the area of Bullfrog Creek, from Cracker Avenue and northward.  It has been moving in and out with the tide.  The odor is of a sour muck like odor (no petroleum or pesticides, etc.).  Dead crabs and some dead fish; some fish gasping for air, so dissolved oxygen is apparently low.  In the past, he said high nitrogen from a sewer plant has caused similar problems, and maybe also high salty water from the Tampa Bay Water plant.  Some mangroves are rotting.  Stingrays were on top of the water.  The plume has moved to near the US 41 bridge.  I said that the DEP sampling team will be notified, and will likely do sampling on Monday 9/26, to determine the possible cause/extent/source.

There was also some confusion regarding the use of nets. She thought it was illegal to use seine nets. I explained that gill nets are illegal, not seine nets.

I have also enclosed a screen capture of the area from Google earth. The lake in question is at the bottom left hand corner of the island and this communicates with a smaller lake which is at the 1 o'clock position relative to the larger lake via a small waterway under a road bridge adjacent to the traffic circle you can see. It was in this smaller part of the lake that the fish started dying first on Sunday (though for a few days before that I had heard and seen fish jumping at night when walking my dog). Initially there were some very small fish, less than an inch long, and they numbered in their thousands. At that time there were just a few larger fish dead. By Tuesday we were seeing dead fish in the larger lake (which is where the photos were taken). This morning, when I took the photos, there were contractors removing the dead fish and the picture that I took was of the one area where there was a concentration but there were individual dead fish all over the lake. What you can see in the photo is a very small fraction of the total kill. Unfortunately there isn't a close-up to enable identification but I would imagine that the management company knows what kind of fish should be in there. I doubt any have survived. 
 
It would seem likely that the fish kill is associated with a strong smell of hydrogen sulphide which has been apparent for the last couple of months at least (that's when we arrived here). The smell is most apparent in the south western corner of the lake but on occasions (such as today) it can be smelt in our condo block (which is right next to the main road which goes down the eastern side of the island. It can be extremely pungent in places. Incidentally, the day before the fish kill I did see foam on the surface of the larger lake in several places.

Hey guys,
I went on an investigation of bass with lesions in a retention pond on SWFWMD property in Tampa on 4.26.13. I was unable to see any fish at all and took a water sample in lugol’s. We didn’t sumbit it for processing as Theresa wants us to be careful in submitting freshwater samples as HAB no longer has a dedicated freshwater person. We held the sample in case the report initiator called back with further instances, but it has been about a month with no word. The water is going to be discarded, and I just want to make sure the investigation sheet/database reflect no water was submitted. Let me know if you have any questions.

It was revealed that the FK started just after the heavy rain event on Friday 5/2. I inquired if there were any other dead organisms & she replied no. I explained that if a contaminant were in the water causing the fish to die then you’re most likely to see other dead organisms. We discussed that a sudden change in water level along with a change in the water chemistry from the run off can cause fish to become stressed & die. I explained how large amounts of organic matter can consume the oxygen in the water as they decay. I told Mrs. Blizzard that I’d enter the FK information on FWC’s website so that they’d have it in their database and that I’d include her information if she’d like, she said that would be fine.

His email read: ""Hello Ann, you may recall that last year I sent several pictures showing a substance on top of water at intersection of Bayway and Maritana East in St Pete Beach. Last year we had many, many fish around the dock; this year if one shows up, he dies (see photo). The pollution has caused ""sewage"" looking algae to grow. I am concerned about wildlife, mangroves and our overall environment. Pls have somebody check the area so we can determine source of pollution before it kills more animals. My phone is 813-245-2436. Thanks for your help. Ed Cockman"". 3/17/15: OER visited the site. Mr. Cockman did not answer his phone, so OER checked the seawall and docks along E. Maritana Drive. The water was clear and normal, with a few occasional spots of apparent pollen floating on the water, and some grass clippings from recent mowing. No sheens or unusual odors were noted. One dead fish and one dead Crab were found in an area of clear water. A storm drain outlet was present; the water in that area was only very slightly turbid. At the southern end, there is a right-angle seawall corner, where there was some odor of stagnation or decay of organic material, but apparently natural. Some greyish sea foam was noted, and pollen afloat.  No dead critters were seen in that area. There was a small patch of greyish mossy-like material that could have been algae or similar, but OER saw no large patches of algae. OER saw no definitive source or cause of dead fish, nor any obvious indications of pollution. The area is tidally-affected, so it gets regular ""flushing"" action, which could disperse episodes of possible pollution. The cause of fish kills that were reportedly occurring is uncertain, and was not verified as ""pollution"" at this time. These findings were relayed to the DEP/Tampa PIO, for re-contacting the caller. A copy was also sent to FWC Fishkill Coordinator Catalina Brown.

(0.5 mg/L) The dead fish were all one species, and there were lots of other fish and aquatic wildlife that were doing ok. It seems as if this species is less tolerant of low oxygen levels. We thought initially that there may have been an algae bloom started from one of the recent heavy rainfalls since this is a retention pond, however nothing significant turned up in the phytoplankton sample that was taken. I explained to the complainant that we couldn't identify what was causing the low DO, but that was certainly the cause.

I have been here many years, as a snowbird, and I have never witnessed a total lack of mullet in the creek when I am here from early Dec. through the end of Apr.  While I am not interested in Mullet, per se, their total absence, as well as that of the Snook and no schools of Jacks attacking minnows against the seawall just puzzles me very much. The Tilapia deaths I can attribute to them being washed into a canal off the creek through a tube under Burnt Store Rd. and then, being unable to tolerate the brackish water in the canal.  On normal water levels they are unable to escape back though that tube to fresh water. DO should be very high due to the heavy rains we had a  while ago.  In fact, the reason I did not contact you earlier is that I thought maybe that large volume of rainwater forced the brackish water downstream temporarily and forced some species out but I believe the creek has stabilized now in that respect.  Also, the temporary low salt content should not have affected the Snook. This condition has existed since late Dec. The Cichlids, upstream, are in normal numbers. I can see nothing wrong with the water clarity.  It has been exceptionally clear except for the periods of heavy rainfall mentioned above. I know there has been some Red Tide in the harbor but that has never affected fish numbers in the creek before.

For this report: I spoke to the caller, Raymond Lopez, resident there for 14 years.  He says it is a manmade pond, unknown if it was a stormwater retention pond or not.  Heavy algae.  His complaint is that the owner of the mobile home park refuses to maintain the pond.  Flies and mosquitoes are rampant.  Ducks crap all over the place.  Homes are in danger of “falling into the pond” due to lack of maintenance.  He wants the pond fenced, and signs put up to tell people not to feed the ducks.

I suggested that he contact the County mosquito control, and I would forward the duck complaint to FWC for a call-back.  There were no signs of any chemical discharges.  I said that since it is a private pond, there is probably little that we could do.  He was not happy with that conclusion.

I don’t see any need for an OER response.

Going through our records, I found that we have been aware of the situation in Snowy Egret Lake since January 2017. Recently, a biologist from our group collected a water sample from this lake and a bloom of cyanobacteria was confirmed. Cyanobacteria is also known as blue-green algae and certain species can produce toxins. I have attached some references for you to read regarding cyanobacteria and pond management. Unfortunately, there is not much that can be done to dissipate the bloom at this point. Rainfall may help to break it up and increase flow. In the future, aeration may be a good option to keep the lake from becoming stagnant, thus preventing the formation of a bloom.

Some of the DO saturations last week were pretty high by mid-morning. It looks like whatever happened was late last week or over the weekend.

I walked the boardwalk from the boat ramp (red 1) to a small drainage offshoot (red 2). I saw no dead fish along the river proper, however it was very thick with vegetation extending out into the water, which may have hidden dead fish. The water was very tannic, and there was a yellowish film across the surface of most of the river. I did not find any dead fish until I reached the drainage offshoot. The water in the drainage was also tannic, but it was tinged through the water column with dark green, and much of the surface looked thick and viscous. The dead fish were decomposed enough so that coloration made identification somewhat difficult, however there were about 100 to 150 mostly smaller fish (5-10”), including crappie and sunfish. I saw no fish gasping, but they were schooling in patches, with many near the outflow of a drainage pipe that created the only flow. Surface water quality was: temp 29.06°C, DO 5.11 mg/L, salinity .015, and pH 7.01. Bottom water quality was similar, with DO only being a bit less at 4.65 mg/L.

But yesterday, we couldn’t breathe outdoors without coughing and sneezing. and dead fish lied along all the shoreline .
water looked better though, but not clear. 
No more dead fish today buy the air still provokes allergic reaction .  
When do you think it should come back to normal? any forecast?

The beach appears to have flood earlier in the day, with a heavy amount of debris and dead fish 10 or so feet up the beach. The water was higher than normal for that part of Gandy Blvd. I would assume that the pinfish are schooling and are trapped by the strong Northly winds and the greater than normal tidal changes. When high tide comes today, I would assume we could see the same fish kill again. Osprey, gulls, and dolphins were observed feeding in the area in large flocks and pods. A water sample was collected and delivered to HAB today. Water parameters were 28.18⁰C, DO 6.50 mg/L, Salinity 17.67, and pH 7.35.

It was relayed to me that our officer received this call and responded to find several dead fish within a small 20’ area of a residential canal off the Manatee River (32nd St NW Riverview Blvd, Bradenton).  The fish included what appeared to be Mahindra, Mullet (both in-tact) and possible Spanish Mackerel (possibly filleted).  Some fish were floating and some were on the bottom.  This appeared to be an isolated incident and the officers believed it was the result of a fisherman dumping his cleaned fish and bait.  While the officers were on scene, another subject (possibly identified as a City of Bradenton attorney) approached them and asked about the fish.  They explained their findings to her too.

We need to focus on staying ahead of this in communication and working on ways we can hold those responsible financially accountable.

People are concerned about what will happen to sports fish closures after this event and want to know if fishing regulations will be modified or perhaps limited. Because Redrum and Snook have been affected, some citizens fear that these species will not be able to recover from the red tide event.

Subject: Red tide in Long Bayou Hi Kate, I know you are probably inundated with red tide, so I apologize for adding. I have been staying at a house in St. Petersburg on Long Bayou. I have not seen dead fish here over the past few days, until today (see pictures attached). Earlier today, about 8 egrets were on her dock, and I watched a few of them pick up some of the dead fish and drop them. Over the course of the day, and especially since the tide went out, more fish have accumulated. My point in emailing you is because I noticed on the FWC Daily Sample Map that there are no samples being taken this far into the sound. I see samples on the Gulf side near Madeira Beach and Redington Shores, but red tide has clearly made its way over here. I attached a map of where the house is located. Is there any way I can help with sampling, or give access to a researcher to take samples? I scooped up the fish I saw this morning, but now there are too many. Please let me know how I can help.
