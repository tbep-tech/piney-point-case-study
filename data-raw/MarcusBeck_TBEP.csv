It was relayed to me that our officer received this call and responded to find several dead fish within a small 20’ area of a residential canal off the Manatee River (32nd St NW Riverview Blvd, Bradenton).  The fish included what appeared to be Mahindra, Mullet (both in-tact) and possible Spanish Mackerel (possibly filleted).  Some fish were floating and some were on the bottom.  This appeared to be an isolated incident and the officers believed it was the result of a fisherman dumping his cleaned fish and bait.  While the officers were on scene, another subject (possibly identified as a City of Bradenton attorney) approached them and asked about the fish.  They explained their findings to her too.

People are concerned about what will happen to sports fish closures after this event and want to know if fishing regulations will be modified or perhaps limited. Because Redrum and Snook have been affected, some citizens fear that these species will not be able to recover from the red tide event. If you have anything that we can pass on to citizens regarding this topic, I appreciate it.

Subject: Red tide in Long Bayou Hi Kate, I know you are probably inundated with red tide, so I apologize for adding. I have been staying at a house in St. Petersburg on Long Bayou. I have not seen dead fish here over the past few days, until today (see pictures attached). Earlier today, about 8 egrets were on her dock, and I watched a few of them pick up some of the dead fish and drop them. Over the course of the day, and especially since the tide went out, more fish have accumulated. My point in emailing you is because I noticed on the FWC Daily Sample Map that there are no samples being taken this far into the sound. I see samples on the Gulf side near Madeira Beach and Redington Shores, but red tide has clearly made its way over here. I attached a map of where the house is located. Is there any way I can help with sampling, or give access to a researcher to take samples? I scooped up the fish I saw this morning, but now there are too many. Please let me know how I can help.

 We recently went to investigate the fish kill at Little Salt Lake in Tarpon Springs. The species affected were primarily tilapia and a water sample was taken. The water sample was dominated by Prymnesium sp., Microcystis aeruginosa, and Microcystis spp.. Based on these findings the fish kill was most likely caused by the Prymnesium species which can secrete a toxin that is lethal to fish. However, the presence of the 2 Microcystis species is of concern for human and animal health, so I have contacted the Department of Environmental Protection to alert them of the situation.
