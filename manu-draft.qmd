## Abstract (150-250 words) {.unnumbered}

{{< pagebreak >}}

## Introduction (500-1500 words)

Provide background for the instructor that helps integrate the case study into disciplinary material and, if possible, relate the case study to ABET General Criteria (Student Outcomes 1-7), Program Criteria for Civil Engineering and Environmental Engineering, and general definitions and statements (e.g., ABETâ€™s Statement on Implementing DEI Concepts into Program Criteria).  The references in this section should focus on pedagogical aspects of the case study. As Section Editor, I can assist with the latter. 

## Background (1000-2000 words)

Provide background information for the study that relates to the events, design process, etc. Make sure to include sufficient information (including pictures, figures, graphs, etc.) so that a novice (i.e., student) can understand the case study. Include references to the events that allow for the reader to investigate further. 

## Student Activities (500-1000 words)

### Classroom discussion questions

Include at least 3 discussion questions based on the case study that can be used in a classroom situation.

### Individual student responses

Include at least 3 questions/prompts based on the case study that can be used in a homework assignment or on an exam. These could include further reading (be sure to provide references to readily available materials) or personal reflections. 

## Conclusion (500-1000 words)

Include a discussion of key take-aways. 

## References {.unnumbered}
